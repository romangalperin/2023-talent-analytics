2023 Talent analytics project
================

## Context

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is one of the most
important organizations for supporting innovation and economic growth.
The USPTO employs over 10,000 patent examiners whose primary task is to
assess inventions for patentability and issue patents when appropriate.

Inventors submit patent applications, pay the associated fees and
receive a decision from a patent examiner. If all of the inventor’s
claims made in a patent application are allowed by the examiner—i.e.,
determined to be novel and non-obvious in light of prior inventions—the
examiner issues a patent.

If some or all of the claims are rejected as not meeting the
patentability criteria, the examiner issues a formal rejection of the
application, which presents the applicant with a choice: abandon the
application and stop the process, or continue the process by revising
the application and resubmitting it to the agency for another round of
consideration. The latter option is associated with additional fees, but
is virtually always open: the applicant can continue to reapply with no
limit on the number of attempts. (This process is described in more
detail
[here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2995674).)

## The challenge

The USPTO has been facing three related challenges:

1.  Application backlog
2.  Shortage of qualified examiners
3.  Concerns about inequities inside the organization that relate to
    gender and race of the examiners

### The backlog problem

Since innovation is dynamic and because patent rights can be highly
valuable for inventors, the timing of the USPTO’s decisions on patent
applications is a sensitive issue for inventors. The USPTO has faced
some pressure from policymakers and regulators to address the problem of
long review times. The agency is interested in understanding what
affects the examination time—the time from the date the application is
filed until a definitive decision is made. Understanding the causes and
the variation in the examination time can help reduce the backlog.

### The shortage of examiners

One of the factor contributing to the average examination time is the
availability of qualified employees—patent examiners—who can make
decision on the applications. Examiners take significant time to recruit
and train, and yet many move across departmental units and some leave
the agency at different points in their careers. Understanding the
reasons for examiner mobility and attrition is an important part of
solving the examination time problem.

### Inequities among examiners

The agency suspects—and has some indirect evidence—that examiners’ work,
promotion across pay grades and attrition differ systematically by
demographic characteristics. Of special concern are patterns related to
examiner’s gender and race/ethnicity, not only because such differences
may pose obvious ethical challenges, but also because they increase the
risk of legal liability for the agency. The USPTO would like to
understand what, if any, patterns in examiners’ work, promotion and
attrition vary systematically by race and/or gender.

## Team project

Your team’s goal is to perform the analysis of the agency’s data as a
consulting team would. Base on the analysis, you will write a short
report (no longer than 10 pages including all figures table and
references, if any). Your analysis will focus on one or more of the
following questions:

- What are the organizational and social factors associated with the
  length of patent application prosecution?
- What influences promotion and exit of patent examiners?
- What is the role of gender, race and ethnicity in the processes
  described in the questions above?

Your report should offer convincing analysis, as well as projections and
related recommendations.

You can and should start working on the project as soon as your group is
formed. Our weekly exercises will help you build the analysis strategy
and move you toward the project’s goal.

## Data

The data on examiners and patent applications come from various public
sources. I have modified some of the source files to make them smaller
and more manageable, but feel free to use the original sources if you
feel compelled.

Small data files are in the *CSV* format, larger ones are in *parquet*
format to reduce size. To read *CSV* files, use `readr` package that is
part of the `tidyverse` package. To read *parquet* files, use `arrow`
package.

Other packages I recommend for working with the data:

- `lubridate` for working with dates
- `stringr` for working with character strings
- `skimr` for quick summaries of data columns
- `gender` for inferring gender from name (there are other options)
- `wru` for predicting race/ethnicity based on name

### Patent applications

The largest data file is on patent applications. It comes from the
[USPTO 2016 PatEx
dataset](https://www.uspto.gov/ip-policy/economic-research/research-datasets/patent-examination-research-dataset-public-pair).
The full data file takes between 0.5Gb and 1Gb of memory, depending on
how you load it, so I have created a smaller subsample of the data for
your convenience, using the following restrictions:

- The year of `filing_date` is 2000 or later
- Only 4 of the 9 [Technology
  Centers](https://www.uspto.gov/patents/contact-patents/patent-technology-centers-management)
  comprising the agency are included: 1600, 1700, 2100 and 2400
- Only 15 relevant variables are included (see [PatEx data
  dictionary](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Appendix%20A.pdf))

``` r
app_data_sample |> tbl_vars()
```

    ## <dplyr:::vars>
    ##  [1] "application_number"   "filing_date"          "examiner_name_last"  
    ##  [4] "examiner_name_first"  "examiner_name_middle" "examiner_id"         
    ##  [7] "examiner_art_unit"    "uspc_class"           "uspc_subclass"       
    ## [10] "patent_number"        "patent_issue_date"    "abandon_date"        
    ## [13] "disposal_type"        "appl_status_code"     "appl_status_date"    
    ## [16] "tc"

### Examiners

Additional data on patent examiners come from FOIA requests made with
the agency by various researchers. The data components are:

- **examiner_gs.csv** contains data on examiner GS pay grade changes

``` r
examiner_gs |> tbl_vars()
```

    ## <dplyr:::vars>
    ## [1] "examiner_name"  "examiner_grade" "start_date"     "end_date"      
    ## [5] "old_pid"        "new_pid"

- **examiner_ids.csv** is a crosswalk table to link to the applications
  data

``` r
examiner_ids |> tbl_vars()
```

    ## <dplyr:::vars>
    ## [1] "old_pid"       "new_pid"       "patex_id"      "examiner_name"
